in the void in the void
in the void in the void
in the void in the void
in the void in the void
in the void

baby
i m spinnin   round the corner
it s tasting kinda lonely
and my mind wants to control me
e e e empty
there s rotten things left in me
injected by society
no one here but me to judge me

pipe down with the noise i cannot bear my sorrow
i hate who i was before
i fear i won t live to see the day tomorrow
someone tell me if this is hell

i gotta escape that void
there is no other choice yeah
tryna turn down the voices
the void ate me
look at the mess i ve done
there is nowhere to run yeah
holdin  a loaded gun
the void
like a priest behind confession walls i judge myself
kneeling on a metal grater
bloody like a body that has died and it s myself
tangled in my own intestines
i gotta escape the void
there is no other choice yeah
gotta escape the void

so strange
i m tryna find a doorway
my eyes are starin  at me
and they seem so damn unhappy
c c c collect
my fickle insecurities
and turn them into beauty
alchemize the dark within me ee ah

pipe down with the noise i cannot bear my sorrow
i hate who i was before
i fear i won t live to see the day tomorrow
someone tell me if this is hell

i gotta escape that void
there is no other choice yeah
tryna turn down the voices
the void ate me
look at the mess i ve done
there is nowhere to run yeah
holdin  a loaded gun
the void
like a priest behind confession walls i judge myself
kneeling on a metal grater
bloody like a body that has died and it s myself
tangled in my own intestines
i gotta escape that void
there is no other choice yeah
tryna turn down the voices
the void ate me
look at the mess i ve done
there is nowhere to run yeah
holdin  a loaded gun
the void
