[verse 1]
i steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
and then i ll be nothing forever
and all of my memories
and all of the things i have seen will be gone
with my eyes with my body with me

[chorus]
but me and my husband
we are doing better
it s always been just him and me
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime
we re sticking together
me and my husband
we re sticking together

[verse 2]
and i m the idiot with the painted face
in the corner taking up space
but when he walks in i am loved i am loved

[chorus]
me and my husband
we are doing better
it s always been just him and me
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime
we re sticking together
me and my husband
we re sticking together
me and my husband
we are doing better
